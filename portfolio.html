              Have a few minutes to spare? Click on the Word_Guess image to the left, and try out my Word-Guess-Game!
              Select a category and try your best to spell out the word. Becareful, you only get 10 wrong guesses! Just
              type the letter that you'd like to use, and the game does the rest.

              <p id="words">
              Good with numbers? Can you add things up quickly? Give CrystalCollector a try! Click on the colorful smoke
              image to the left. At the opening of the game, a goal number is selected at random, and it's your job to
              match that number by clicking on the crystals. Each crystal has it's OWN randomly picked number, and the
              goal is to make your crystal numbers add up to the same amount as the goal number.
              I would challenge you to start a stop watch, and see how quickly you can add up your crystals!
              <br>
              I hope you enjoy! -JP

              Like Trivia?! Great!
              Select a category, and try your best to guess the word. But, be careful because you have limited tries to
              guess!
