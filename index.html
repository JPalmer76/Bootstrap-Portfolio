                    <p class="text">Well, as you probably know by now, judging by the large heading above, My Name is Jon Palmer. I
                        was born in Northridge, CA on Arpil the 8th, 1976. I lived in Sunny, Southern California for
                        most of my life. Some may feel that I was spoiled as a child because of this...I had a pretty
                        great childhood!</p>
                    <p class="text">I learned to play music in the 6th grade, and took to it pretty naturally, though no one in my
                        immediate family played at all. I learned to play the upright bass, and played in an orchestra
                        for 3 years, then switch to electric bass when I moved into high school. There, I was pulled
                        into the high school jazz band. I had fun, but my heart was never into it, as I was always
                        watching the drummer and wishing I was sitting at his instrument. Well, years later, I got my
                        chance and it is an absolutly crazy story!! Which I will have to tell another time....</p>
                    <p class="text">I started, and played in a band professionally starting in 1995, and we got signed to DreamWorks
                        music in 1999. We released our first record in 2000 and instantly had a hit single. You may not
                        know the band (most people don't know them by name), Lifehouse, but you would know the fisrt hit
                        song(Hangin by a Moment) for sure. </p>
                    <p class="text">However, I got fired from the band in mid 2000, and ended up moving to Redding, CA and lived with
                        mom and dad for a while so I could get back on my feet and make a plan. The entire 5 years prior
                        wasn't a waste. I met the woman I'd spend the rest of my life with during that time, and married
                        her in 2001! We now have 3 teen age boys ranging in age from 17 to 14...My middle son is 15. I
                        have been married for 18 years as of July 7th 2019. I love my family!!</p>
                    <p class="text">That is a very high level view of my past, but that now brings us to the current day. I work for
                        Louisiana Pacific Building Solutions. I've been in Marketing for about a year and a half now,
                        and don't like it. I've been with the company for 5 years, and this is the first time in my
                        tenure that I feel that I'm being forced to be fake(as marketers are). My brother in law went to
                        a Galvanized Coding Bootcamp in Seattle, and has become a very successful software engineer.
                        Also a musician, he and I think and work in a very similar way. I always used to think that
                        coding was the work of geniuses, and there would be no way in hell that I'd ever be able to do
                        that, but here I am!! With my brother in law's encouragement, and my determination to do
                        something big, I am now here in Vanderbilt's Coding Bootcamp, and loving every bit of it. Here's
                        to the future! CHEERS!</p>
